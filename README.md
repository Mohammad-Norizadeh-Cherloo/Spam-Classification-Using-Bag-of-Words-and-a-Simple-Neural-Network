#  Spam Classification Using Bag-of-Words and a Simple Neural Network (MLP)
This project implements a complete spam-detection pipeline using the Bag-of-Words (BoW) feature-extraction technique combined with a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier.
The code demonstrates how raw text messages are preprocessed, converted into numerical feature vectors,and classified using a simple neural network. This repository is ideal for beginners in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning, and serves as a practical example for text classification tasks such as spam filtering.

**Features**
+ Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal)
+ Bag-of-Words vectorization
+ Building and training an MLP classifier
+ Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
+ Fully reproducible notebook/script for learning or teaching
  
**Use cases**
+ Great for introduction to NLP pipelines, machine learning workflows, and deep learning for text classification.
